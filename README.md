# HUA2

HUA2 is a gene in the 15th chromosome of yeast. Located at around 848500 to 849200, this gene has no apparent use.
The protein this gene codes for is 243 amino acids long, and the gene itself is 729 Nucleobases long.

The protein has a possible role in actin patch assembly

According to the BLAST results, this gene is found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain ySR127, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BSPX042. However, it is interesting that the location of the gene is different between the yeastgenome.org website and the NCBI database.

When I used tblastn, the top results were from an mRNA sequence and a synthetic cloned yeast.

When I used blastx, the results had less of a match, but were mostly in the 95% - 99% range, however, there are 3 results that had a match of around 65%.

Comparing with humans, there were no matches with the nucleotide sequence, nor with the protein sequence.
